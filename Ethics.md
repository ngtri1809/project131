As creators of the S-mail email service, it is our responsibility in providing a secure, confidential, and efficient means of communication for the public. Firstly, S-mail saves our user’s login information inside a database which allows a consumer to enter their email and password to allow access to a registered account. We are accountable for any incidents where the database is compromised, which is why we have implemented hash programming via werkzeug.security, so that any hackers who attempt to access the database only see the hash version of the user’s information. Secondly, take responsibility in ensuring that the messages sent between users are kept private. By maintaining confidentiality, we are protecting our consumers’ right to privacy, giving them some peace of mind. 
Throughout history, innovations produced by engineers have shifted the livelihood of humanity in many forms. This is evident from modern forms of renewable energy becoming a mainstay in society such as solar panels, and wind turbines. Not only that, but on an economic level, significantly less people buy stamps nowadays, and communication has become more cost effective, and less time consuming compared to sending letters where the consumer needs to spend on stamps, and paper. Additionally, new innovations in technology have benefits that affect people all over the world such as the iPhone, a product that effectively shifted the lifestyles of citizens all over the world. The introduction of the iPhone and social media not only changed our society, but also our capability of reaching out to another human being thousands of miles away.
